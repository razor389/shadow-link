# ShadowLink

ShadowLink is a decentralized, encrypted messaging network inspired by Bitmessage, but redesigned for scalability, security, and efficiency using modern cryptographic techniques. This project is implemented in Rust, leveraging its safety guarantees and performance.

## Overview

ShadowLink builds on the core ideas of Bitmessage but introduces key improvements for scalability, robustness, and improved anonymity. Nodes and clients form the backbone of the network, providing both storage and communication capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Encrypted Messaging**: End-to-end encryption using Curve25519 for key exchange and Ed25519 for authentication.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Address-prefix-based routing using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) ensures efficient message handling while preserving anonymity.
- **Spam Prevention**: Proof of Memory (PoM) using Argon2id to prevent network abuse.
- **Flexible Operation Modes**: Operates in either client or node mode.

## Project Structure

The project is organized to separate concerns, providing a modular and maintainable codebase:

- **`/bin/client.rs`**: The client binary for sending and receiving messages.
- **`/bin/node.rs`**: The node binary for participating in the network, storing, and forwarding messages.
- **`/src/types`**: Core types used across the application, such as `ShadowAddress`, `Packet`, and proofs for blockchain interactions.
- **`/src/network`**: Networking code, including peer-to-peer communication and gossip protocols.
- **`/src/storage`**: Message storage, proof verification, and message relay handling.
- **`/src/crypto`**: Encryption and authentication functionality.
- **`/src/utils`**: Helper functions and utilities shared across modules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and its toolchain.
- Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/razor389/shadow-link.git
  cd shadow-link
  ```

### Building the Project

1. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run tests to verify functionality:

   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Usage

ShadowLink can operate in either **node mode** or **client mode**, depending on your use case.

### Running as a Node

Nodes form the backbone of the network, handling message storage, routing, and distribution.

1. Start a node:

   ```bash
   cargo run --release --bin node -- --address "127.0.0.1:12345" --connect "127.0.0.1:12346"
   ```

   - `--address`: The nodeâ€™s IP and port.
   - `--connect`: (Optional) Connect to other nodes by providing their addresses.

2. Nodes automatically begin gossiping with peers and handling messages for assigned prefixes.

### Running as a Client

Clients interact with the network by sending and receiving encrypted messages.

1. Start a client:

   ```bash
   cargo run --release --bin client -- --address "127.0.0.1:12345"
   ```

   - `--address`: The IP and port of the node to connect to.

2. The client can send and receive encrypted messages.

## Logging

Configure logging levels using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

- **Bash**:

  ```bash
  export RUST_LOG=info
  ```

- **PowerShell**:

  ```powershell
  $env:RUST_LOG="info"
  ```

Use `--nocapture` to view logs during test runs:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
